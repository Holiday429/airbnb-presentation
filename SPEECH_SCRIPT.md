# PART 1 — INTRODUCTION
### (~5 minutes)

---

**[Slide: Landing Page — "Welcome to Holiday's Career Journey"]**

Hi everyone — thank you so much for being here today. I'm genuinely excited to share this with you, and I've put a lot of thought into how to make this feel less like a formal presentation and more like a real conversation about the work I love.

So — I'm Holiday. And before I get into the professional story, I want to start with something a little more personal, because I think it explains everything that follows.

---

**[Slide: About Me — Profile Card]**

I've spent the past five years as a digital nomad. That means I've worked from cafes in Tokyo, rooftops in Chiang Mai, and co-working spaces in Lisbon. I've stayed in 109 places across more than 30 countries — most of them through Airbnb. I've been an Airbnb user for nine years. Not just a casual one. The kind who reads host reviews like they're short stories, who chooses a city based on what the listing photos feel like.

I was born in the 90s in China, I speak Chinese, English, Cantonese, and a little Japanese. And professionally, I sit at the intersection of localization, program management, and product thinking.

But honestly, what shapes how I work is this: I'm someone who is obsessed with giving birth to the unconventional. I want to find the human thread inside complex systems and pull on it until something genuinely useful comes out.

---

**[Slide: Career Journey]**

Let me walk you quickly through how I got here.

I started in hospitality. Club Med, Agoda — the world of travel and guest experience. That foundation gave me something most PMs don't have: a deep, almost instinctive sense of what it means to serve someone well. To anticipate what they need before they ask for it.

From there, I transitioned into tech. I've worked with companies like Google, TheSoul Publishing, and — most recently and most deeply — Samsung. Along the way, I've held roles that span localization management, product management, and program management. The thread through all of it? Systems. I build the systems that help great work happen consistently, at scale.

Each stop has layered on something new. And I'll be honest with you: every role I've taken has been a deliberate move toward the kind of work I'm going to tell you about today.

---

**[Slide: My Interests]**

A quick word about who I am beyond work — because I think this matters for the kind of PM I am.

I'm a photographer. I shoot street, landscape, and people — especially in cities I'm visiting for the first time. Photography trained me to notice what other people walk past. That habit of close attention shows up in how I think about user experience.

I'm a reader — business, design theory, fiction. I believe the best PMs are also good readers of humans. I'm also deeply interested in design and exhibitions. I've held two solo photography exhibitions, and I run a podcast and a documentary series about the lives of people who live differently.

And I do Thai boxing. Which is relevant only because: I am not afraid of contact.

# PART 2A — PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS: PROJECT 1
### Conversational New Features for Samsung Bixby (China Market)
### (~15–17 minutes)

---

**[Slide: Project 1 — Overview]**

Alright. Let's get into the work.

The first project I want to walk you through is what I'll call the Conversational New Features program at Samsung Bixby — specifically for the Chinese market.

Before I dive in, let me make sure we're all on the same page about what Bixby is — and this context applies to both projects I'm covering today.

Bixby is Samsung's native voice AI assistant. Think of it as Samsung's Siri. It doesn't just answer questions — it controls your phone's system, your installed apps, and eventually your smart home devices. It's designed to feel like a virtual companion, not just a tool. It has a distinct persona. It has a voice, a tone, a personality.

And the version of Bixby I worked on was built for China — which means a completely separate AI infrastructure, different content regulations, and a very different cultural context than what Samsung's global teams were developing.

So: Project 1. We launched over 40 conversational features for the Chinese Bixby product. 40+ features. 6+ categories. All delivered during the time I owned this program.

---

**[Slide: Project 1 — Context: Project Goals & Why this project?]**

Let me start with the "why." Why invest in these kinds of features at all?

First — **daily life assistance.** Bixby could be genuinely useful in ways users hadn't yet experienced. Not just answering "what's the weather" but actually weaving itself into your morning routine, your seasonal rhythms, your cultural calendar.

Second — **making phone interaction fun.** Voice interaction had a reputation for being awkward or robotic. We wanted to change that — to make people genuinely enjoy talking to their phone.

Third — **cultivating a voice-first habit.** This is the strategic long game. If users get comfortable using voice on their phone, they'll be ready to use it on their smart TV, their fridge, their air conditioner. Every feature we launched on the phone was planting a seed for the IoT ecosystem.

And fourth — **localization for market retention.** Samsung's global features weren't always designed with Chinese users in mind. This program was explicitly about earning — and keeping — loyalty in a critical market.

---

**[Slide: Project 1 — Scenarios (User Stories)]**

Now, let me bring this to life with three scenarios. These are real use cases from our feature set.

**[Tab: 24 Solar Terms]**

Imagine it's winter in Beijing. You live alone. You're getting ready to leave for work and you say, "Hi Bixby."

Bixby responds — warmly, enthusiastically — "Good morning! Today is Winter Solstice. Bundle up — it's going to be really cold outside. How about dumplings or tangyuan tonight? And don't forget to call your family!"

That's the 24 Solar Terms feature. China follows a traditional agricultural calendar with 24 distinct solar terms — each one carrying cultural meaning, food traditions, weather cues, and family rituals. We built Bixby to understand and celebrate each one. Proactive. Context-aware. Zero setup required.

This is what I mean when I say: technology can be an expression of cultural care.

**[Tab: Knowledge Rush]**

Now imagine a different scenario. You're at a small gathering — four or five friends, a few drinks, and someone says "we should play a game." You don't want to download something, set up accounts, or split into teams. You just want to play.

You pull out your phone. "Hi Bixby, let's do trivia."

Bixby becomes your game host — asking questions out loud, giving hints, showing answers on screen. Everyone in the room can hear and participate. No app to download. No account to create. Just voice, instantly.

This is the Knowledge Rush feature. It solved a real social friction point. And it also had a clever side effect — every person in that room was now a Bixby user, even if they'd never tried it before.

**[Tab: Home Helper]**

Third scenario. You're working from home — it's 2022, most of us were doing a lot of that. You've been at your desk for three hours. You want to cook something but have no inspiration. Or you want to stretch but don't know where to start.

"Hi Bixby, what should I cook today?" — and Bixby walks you through options, lets you browse by voice, and links out to a recipe app with one command. Or: "Bixby, give me a quick stretch" — and you get a simple guided routine.

The Home Helper feature was built for the long pandemic-era stretch at home. It was hands-free, app-integrated, and genuinely useful. It also taught us something important about cross-app integration — which became foundational to Project 2.

---

**[Slide: Project 1 — My Role]**

Now let me be specific about what I actually did.

My role was a hybrid of Product Manager and Program Manager. I sat at the center of this program.

On the product side: I was the one who identified user needs, generated feature ideas, and designed the conversational logic flows. When I said "let's build a 24 Solar Terms feature," I was also the person writing out how the conversation would unfold — what Bixby says, what triggers what, how the user journey flows.

On the program side: I owned the end-to-end delivery. That means planning, scheduling, coordinating, and tracking every sub-project from idea to launch.

My stakeholders were three core functions:
- **Localization writers** — the people who crafted the actual dialogue and conversational content
- **UI/UX designers** — who handled the visual experience, the persona expression in seasonal UI, and the cross-app transition design
- **Engineers** — who built the trigger mechanisms, backend logic, and third-party app integrations

I was the single point of accountability across all three. When something was unclear, I clarified. When timelines slipped, I recalibrated. When a feature type was new — and there were many — I built the SOP for it from scratch.

---

**[Slide: Project 1 — Impact]**

The results:

**40+ features** launched during my tenure — across six category types, covering seasons, trivia, lifestyle, fashion, wellness, and cultural heritage.

**A scalable SOP framework** that didn't exist before me. Each feature type — informational, interactive, cross-app — got its own workflow template. That framework is what made the volume of launches possible.

**Increased usage and positive reviews** for Bixby in the Chinese market. We moved the needle on a product that had struggled with engagement.

And personally — I built a way of working that I'm genuinely proud of. Every feature shipped on time. Zero missed critical deadlines. That record includes time-sensitive features like holiday and seasonal content with fixed calendar windows.

---

**[Slide: Project 1 — Challenges & Trade-offs]**

Let me be honest about what was hard.

**Challenge 1: Workflow flexibility.** This program looked simple from the outside — "just build more features." But every new feature type had genuinely unique requirements. An informational feature like the Solar Terms needs to be proactive and push information. A game like Knowledge Rush is interactive and pull-based — the system needs to wait, respond, branch. You can't reuse the same SOP. I had to recognize each new pattern and rebuild the template for it.

My solution: I treated each new feature type as a design challenge in itself. I documented what was unique, what could be reused, and what needed to be built from scratch. Over time, I had a library of SOP templates that the whole team could leverage.

**Challenge 2: Time management across parallel workstreams.** At any given moment, I was running 4–6 projects simultaneously — at different stages of development, with different team compositions, and different deadline sensitivities. A 24 Solar Terms feature had a hard calendar deadline: it had to launch before the actual solar term. A trivia feature was more flexible. I had to be agile enough to reprioritize in real time.

My solution: Clear priority tiers, dedicated weekly check-ins per project, and a shared tracking system that gave everyone visibility into the full program.

**Trade-off: The Phone Tips feature.** I want to tell you about a feature proposal I made that we ultimately decided not to launch, because I think the decision says something important about good PM judgment.

The idea was a "Phone Tips" feature — Bixby surfacing hidden, useful capabilities that most users don't know about. Studies show users typically access less than 20% of their phone's features. There's real value to unlock there.

But Samsung has an enormous product line. Dozens of models, with different feature sets, different UI paths, different terminology. To do this feature *right* would mean building and maintaining a compatibility matrix across every device — and constantly updating it as new models launched.

The cost-benefit didn't work. The maintenance burden would have outlasted the value. We scoped it out.

What I'd do differently: If I were doing this again, I'd propose repurposing that content as device-specific guides in Samsung's official user manuals — where the audience is already filtered by device model. Same content strategy, much more sustainable delivery mechanism.

This project taught me that a good idea isn't always a good project. Scope, feasibility, and timing matter just as much as the idea itself.

# PART 2B — PROJECT HIGHLIGHTS: PROJECT 2
### Bixby 4.0 AI Integration — Global Markets × IoT Ecosystem
### (~15–17 minutes)

---

**[Slide: Project 2 — Overview]**

The second project I want to talk about is a direct evolution from the first.

If Project 1 was about building a rich library of human-crafted conversational experiences — Project 2 is about what happens when you replace "human-crafted" with "AI-generated." At scale. Globally.

This is the Bixby 4.0 AI Integration program. And it's one of the most technically and operationally complex programs I've run.

The core challenge: Samsung wanted to infuse large language model capabilities into Bixby across its entire device ecosystem — not just phones and tablets, but the full Samsung SmartThings smart home lineup. Refrigerators. Air conditioners. Washing machines. Robot vacuums.

The scale was enormous. The stakes were high — this was a group-level strategic initiative touching every global market.

---

**[Slide: Project 2 — Context: Why AI Integration & Bixby's Transformation]**

Let me quickly frame both why we did this and what the transformation looks like.

On the "why" side — there are really four forces pushing this:

One: AI has evolved to the point where it genuinely can handle the complexity of conversational assistant responses. The technology finally caught up to the ambition.

Two: The old model couldn't scale. In the world I described in Project 1, everything was manually crafted. Linguists and writers produced every response. That model works for a curated library of features — but it can't handle the full universe of things a user might say. You'd need an infinite team of writers.

Three: User expectations have shifted. People aren't satisfied with scripted, predictable assistants anymore. They want AI that feels alive, responsive, genuinely helpful.

Four: The IoT opportunity. Samsung's smart home lineup is massive, and Bixby had the potential to become the unified intelligent layer across all of it — one voice, one assistant, for your entire home.

On the transformation side — the contrast between Bixby before and after is stark. Before: scripted responses by writers, limited to phones, China-specific programs. After: LLM-generated answers that can handle virtually anything, cross-app task execution, full IoT control, global deployment.

---

**[Slide: Project 2 — Scenarios (AI in Action)]**

Let me show you what this actually looks like in practice.

**[Tab: Cross-App Execution]**

"Hi Bixby — find me a flight to Honolulu."

Bixby searches the internet, surfaces results, and shows you the best options on screen. You see round-trip from $300, one-way from $139. A specific flight: 7:00 AM departure, 5 hours, $328.

Then you say: "Share this with Robert."

And this is where it gets interesting. Bixby doesn't just copy-paste a link. It understands the full task chain:
1. Parse the intent: find Robert, share flight info
2. Search contacts for Robert → finds "Robert, 408-813-5524"
3. Compose a text message with the relevant flight details
4. Ask for confirmation: "Should I send this message?"
5. You say "Yes" → message sent

Then: "Set an alarm for December 10th at 6 PM."
Bixby creates it instantly. No app switching, no typing, no friction.

This is Bixby as an agent — not just an answering machine, but a system that executes multi-step tasks across applications on your behalf.

**[Tab: IoT Smart Home]**

Now imagine you're at home. You say: "The room is too bright."

Bixby closes the blinds.

You say: "It's stuffy in here."

Bixby sets the AC to 24 degrees Celsius. And turns on the air purifier.

It doesn't need you to say "close the blinds" or "set AC to 24." It interprets the underlying need — "stuffy" maps to "needs air movement and cooling" — and acts accordingly.

That's the IoT integration. Natural language, interpreted in context, executed across devices.

---

**[Slide: Project 2 — My Role]**

In this project, my role was Localization Manager and Program Manager — and honestly, the scope was much wider than either title suggests.

My specific responsibilities fell into six buckets:

**LLM scoring standards.** We needed to evaluate AI-generated responses for quality. I built the framework for how we scored them — accuracy, naturalness, brand voice alignment, UX consistency. Without this, "good" was undefined. With it, every evaluator was working from the same rubric.

**AI training pipeline design.** I designed and continuously optimized the pipeline that took raw data — user utterances, intended responses, contextual information — and transformed it into training-ready format. This included data annotation, entity recognition, intent classification, and multiple rounds of review.

**Team building and enablement.** We onboarded a new team of data specialists who had no prior experience with Samsung's IoT ecosystem or Bixby's logic. I structured the ramp-up: workshops, training sessions, documented guides.

**Cross-functional coordination.** My stakeholders included: data annotation teams, localization writers, AI and algorithm engineers, and UX designers. All of them, all at once.

**Timeline management and delivery.** This was a program with massive data volume, strict formatting requirements, and zero tolerance for errors — because errors in AI training data compound downstream.

**Zero-risk deployment.** We achieved full deployment with no critical post-launch issues. That doesn't happen by accident.

---

**[Slide: Project 2 — Impact]**

The numbers:

I raised the AI response acceptance rate from **52% to 91.75%**. That means when we started, roughly half of AI-generated responses were being rejected as not good enough. By the time we were done, almost all of them were approved. That's a 40-point improvement — which translates directly to how fast the product can ship and how much manual rework the team has to do.

We elevated data acceptance rates to **95%+** — meaning the data we fed into the training pipeline met quality standards at near-perfect levels.

We reduced the delivery timeline by **18%** — not by cutting corners, but by optimizing the workflow to eliminate unnecessary steps and bottlenecks.

And: **zero-risk deployment.** The integration went live without critical issues.

---

**[Slide: Project 2 — Challenges & Actions]**

Let me walk through what made this hard — because none of those numbers came easy.

**Challenge 1: Localization complexity.** China's regulatory environment means you can't use the same LLMs in China that you'd use globally. We needed entirely separate AI model pipelines — one for the Chinese market, one for international markets. Different data, different evaluation criteria, different toolchains. Maintaining quality parity across both was a constant exercise in coordination.

**Challenge 2: Rapid team scaling.** We onboarded a new team of data specialists at pace. They were technically capable, but they lacked context — they didn't understand Bixby's persona, didn't know how Samsung's IoT logic worked, didn't understand why certain phrasings were wrong even when they were grammatically correct.

My response: I ran a series of targeted workshops. Not generic onboarding — workshops specifically designed around the failure modes I'd already seen in the data. I also created a Terminology Library and a Persona-Driven Response Playbook — so every team member had a single source of truth for how Bixby talks, what it values, and what it never does.

**Challenge 3: Linguistic and UX gaps.** Machine translation was insufficient. Bixby's persona — its warmth, its humor, its specific vocabulary — doesn't survive a raw machine translation. And device-specific terminology (the way you refer to a setting in Bixby's UI when it's on a refrigerator vs. a phone) needed careful, human-guided localization.

My response: The Terminology Library. And a HITL (Human-In-The-Loop) workflow that ensured human review at every critical decision point, even as we scaled up AI-generated volume.

**Challenge 4: Data volume and precision.** We were processing massive datasets with strict formatting requirements — including code files where a single character error could break the entire pipeline. This required multiple rounds of review, clear ownership at each stage, and a culture of precision that I had to actively build into the team.

My response: Systematic QA checkpoints, clear handoff protocols, and a mindset of "precision is not perfectionism — it's professionalism."

# PART 3 — CLOSING REFLECTIONS
### Next Destination
### (~7–8 minutes)

---

**[Slide: Next Destination — Boarding Pass]**

So. Here we are at the final destination.

I've shown you two projects that I'm genuinely proud of. One rooted in cultural creativity and product instinct. One rooted in systems, AI, and operational precision. Together, they represent a kind of journey — from the manual era to the AI era, from single-device to full ecosystem, from local market to global scale.

And both of them shaped how I think about the role I'm interviewing for today.

---

**[Slide: Chapter 01 — What I Love & Where I Shine]**

Let me be direct about what I love doing.

I love building the systems that make great work inevitable. Not the kind of process that slows teams down — the kind that clears the runway so creative people can focus entirely on the work that matters.

I'm strongest at four things:

**Systems thinking.** I see the scaffolding behind the work, and I build it better. Every SOP I created at Samsung started as a question: "What is the minimum viable process that makes this reproducible?" Not more overhead — just enough structure to be reliable.

**Cross-functional orchestration.** I am genuinely fluent across design, engineering, AI, and localization. I don't just manage these relationships — I understand each team's logic, their constraints, what matters to them. That lets me translate between worlds instead of just facilitating between them.

**Quality at scale.** Moving from 52% to 91.75% AI acceptance. 40+ features launched without a single missed critical deadline. These aren't lucky outcomes — they're the result of systems designed to produce quality reliably.

**Making complex things human.** Whether I'm designing Bixby's conversational persona or explaining a technical constraint to a designer — I find the human thread and make it land.

---

**[Slide: Chapter 02 — Where I'll Have the Biggest Impact]**

I've thought carefully about where I can have the greatest impact at Airbnb specifically.

**Design infrastructure.** I want to build the operational backbone that lets designers at Airbnb focus entirely on designing. Not on coordination overhead, not on status updates, not on alignment meetings that could be a doc. I know what it looks like when PM infrastructure is absent — and I know what it looks like when it's done right.

**Global program leadership.** I've spent my career at the intersection of cultures. My Samsung work covered both the Chinese market — with all its unique regulatory, linguistic, and cultural complexity — and then global deployment across multiple markets. Airbnb is a deeply international product. I speak that language.

**AI × Design.** This is a frontier question for every design organization right now: how do you integrate AI into creative workflows without losing the craft, the voice, the human intuition that makes great design? I've spent two years building the answer to that question in a different industry. I want to bring it here.

---

**[Slide: Chapter 03 — Problems That Drive Me]**

The problems that genuinely motivate me:

How do world-class design teams stay world-class as they scale? Airbnb's design team is extraordinary. The question is: what's the operational infrastructure that lets that extraordinariness be consistent, not occasional?

How does AI augment creative work without erasing the human voice? I've trained LLMs while preserving persona and empathy. I know that getting this right is hard — and that getting it wrong is costly.

And the deepest one: How do you design for belonging at a global scale? That's Airbnb's core question. And it's one I've been training for — through a decade of cross-cultural work, through living in 30+ countries, through designing for Chinese users, through building AI that needs to feel human across languages and contexts.

---

**[Slide: Chapter 04 — Vision for Design PM]**

Here's how I think about the role of Design Program Manager.

Design PM is the invisible connective tissue that makes visible work shine. It's not a gatekeeper role — it's a multiplier role. Not a process enforcer — a thought partner who makes great design inevitable.

The best Design PM I can be would:
- Build systems that scale craft, not just output
- Protect creative focus time for designers
- Bridge design vision and cross-functional execution — not just facilitate, but actually translate
- Bring clarity to ambiguity, and make hard decisions easier to make

I don't see this as a support role. I see it as a strategic one. When Design PM is done well, the design team moves faster, ships more confidently, and makes better decisions. That's the version of this role I want to build at Airbnb.

---

**[Slide: Why Airbnb?]**

One last thing — and I want to be real about this.

I've been an Airbnb user for nine years. 109 trips. Fifty-six stays where I reviewed my host afterward. I've lost all my cash and ID during an Airbnb stay — and the host still took care of me. I've been bitten by a snake at an Airbnb — and the whole community rallied.

Those aren't hotel stories. Those are human stories. And they happened because Airbnb built something that made belonging possible between strangers.

That's not a small thing to build. And it's not an accident. It's the result of design decisions, cultural choices, product values that someone had to fight for in rooms exactly like this one.

My nomadic life is Airbnb's mission. I have lived, for five years, what you are trying to make possible for people around the world. I understand your users from the inside.

I want to work on something I genuinely believe in. And this is it.

---

**[Slide: Final — "Let's build something meaningful together."]**

A decade of exploration — across hospitality, technology, localization, and creative work — has been pointing toward this.

I'm ready to board.

Thank you.

> **[Q&A — prepared talking points to have ready]**
>
> - Biggest mistake as a PM? → The Phone Tips feature decision (could have scoped it differently earlier). Learned: feasibility checks should happen before ideation, not after.
> - How do you handle stakeholder conflict? → Use the Samsung AI Integration example: when the AI team and localization team had different definitions of "quality," I built a shared rubric that both sides could align on.
> - What's your management style? → Clarity over comfort. I'd rather have a hard conversation early than a bigger problem later. And I believe process should serve people, not the other way around.
> - How do you stay design-sensitive without being a designer? → Photography, reading, exhibitions. And years of working alongside designers — I've learned to read their decision-making logic, not just their output.
> - Why Design PM specifically? → Because I believe design is Airbnb's core strategic advantage. Program management in service of that is the highest-leverage thing I can do.
